<h1 align="center">Introduction to Slim</h1>

# Create a Slim HitTastic! application. It should have these routes:
* the 'root' route (/). This should display ALL songs in the database. Hint: create a
string variable, add (append) each result in turn to it in your while loop, and then
output the string variable as your response.

- the route /artist/{artist}. This should show all songs by the artist specified in the
placeholder, using the same technique as the 'root' route.

- the route /artist/{artist}/song/{song}. This should show a given song by a given
artist.
