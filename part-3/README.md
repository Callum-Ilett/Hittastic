# HTML and CSS revision

1. Create a second page, `signup.html`. Give the form a method of "post"
rather than "get". This should allow a user to sign up for HitTastic! Add a form with six fields:
- Username
- Password
- Name
- Day of birth
- Month of birth
- Year of birth

Again, shortly you will make the signup actually work. Also, again make sure
the form has a submit button.

Again, upload it to the Neptune server via FileZilla or within EPHP.
Also, once again prove that it has indeed uploaded to Neptune by opening a
separate tab in your web browser and going to
http://ephp.solent.ac.uk/~ephpXXX/signup.html

2. At the bottom of the `index.html page`, add a hyperlink to the signup.html
page. On the signup page, add a hyperlink back to the main page. Test the
hyperlink works by viewing them in your browser - first go to the index page
at: http://ephp.solent.ac.uk/~ephpXXX/index.html and follow the link to the signup page.

3. Style your two pages using an external CSS stylesheet.
