<h1 align="center">Week-1(Clients, Servers and HTTP)</h1>

**Introduction**

In the DFTI unit we will be developing dynamic websites which interact with
the user. In the practical tutorial sessions, you will be building up
HitTastic!, a dynamic, interactive music website, which, when you complete
it, will allow the user to search a database of top 40 hits.

This lesson you will: 
- familiarise yourself with file transfer to a web server;
- understand communication between web browsers and web servers;
- be introduced the PHP learning environment EPHP and use it to become
familiar with how clients and servers communicate with each other via HTTP
requests and responses

The lesson is split into 3 parts:  
1. [Creating a basic HTML page and uploading it to the server](part-1)
2. [Exploring Web Communication In More Detail](part-2)
3. [HTML and CSS revision](part-3)
